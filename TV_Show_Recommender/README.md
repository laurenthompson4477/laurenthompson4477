This project looked at a dataset with 2500 TV shows to allow users who are on the same account or profile who have different preferences not to interfere with what is recommended for one another. This was accomplished by first preforming an EDA to assess the limitations, challenges, and variables within the dataset. Then creating tags to assess the cosine similarity through vectors. Finaly, getting user input of a TV show title to produce the top 5 shows recommended that they may like.
