Project Description:<br>
The purpose of this project is to cut down on decision making time and assist customers in picking a new TV show to watch. This will help keep customers satisfied with a streaming service as the recommended shows will be based on previous ones the customer liked per their input and help to create a customized selection. Users who are on the same account but have different preferences may interfere with other recommender systems as other systems are based on tracking show likes and searches. The recommendations from this project are through a search feature rather than tracking allowing multiple users to use the same profile.

Summary: <br>
This project looked at a dataset with 2500 TV shows to allow users who are on the same account or profile who have different preferences not to interfere with what is recommended for one another. This was accomplished by first preforming an EDA to assess the limitations, challenges, and variables within the dataset. Then creating tags to assess the cosine similarity through vectors. Finaly, getting user input of a TV show title to produce the top 5 shows recommended that they may like.
