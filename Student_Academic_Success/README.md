Project Description:<br>
The purpose of this project, “Predictive student academic success”, is to look at students’ demographics, school habits, and home environment to identify which features are important for predicting a student’s academic success. This can assist students in being aware of the top feature influencing performance and assist them in achieving academic success.

Files Needed:<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;student_data.csv<br>
	&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Predictive_Student_Academic_Success.ipynb

How to Run: <br>
Download the files needed, see list above, and ensure they are saved in the same directory. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where the files are stored. Run the notebook, no alterations to code should need to be made. 

Summary: <br>
The SVM model predicts the target feature grade with 75% accuracy. The top features effecting student academic success are attendance, study time, and parental support. For a student to receive higher academic success they most ensure their attendance is consistent by going to class as well as reviewing and studying the material presented in class. Parental support also effects student’s academic success however this is not controllable by the student.
